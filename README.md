# Hev's More Minerals

###### A Mod that adds considerably more mineral variety to your game. A modified merger of the legacy MoreMinerals and RealisticMinerals mods.

> [!WARNING]
> HevLib is required for this mod to function.
> A download can be found from it's [releases page](https://github.com/rwqfsfasxc100/HevLib/releases/latest)

## Features:

- 22 new mineral types!

- 20 new Obonto Trades!

- Multiple minerals per chunk!

  - Enabled in HevLib rather than through this mod.
  - Every mineral chunk has a chance to contain more than one type of mineral.
  - Less pure mineral chunks will tend to contain more of the other minerals.

## Installation:

To install, go to the game's installation directory (the directory containing `Delta-V.pck`), and create a new directory called `mods`. Place the mod `.zip` in this `mods` directory, this must be `Hevs-More-Minerals.zip` and not an extracted folder.

To run the game with mods, run it with the `--enable-mods` command-line parameter. If using Steam, you can add the parameter in the game's properties → General → Launch Options.
